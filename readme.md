### Python 3.10.3 
* Machine: arm64
* Platform: macOS-13.0-arm64-arm-64bit

### Description
This project is intended to present itself as a concluding exercise in the Python course:
[Advanced Python Programming: Build 10 OOP Applications](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-pro-course/).

In this exercise I tried to put into practice some of the concepts from the course, from creating
of databases through python developing web pages (with Flask) and using API.

The project recalls the last exercise of the course, where a call was being made 
to a weather Website through API to get tomorrow's weather data, in contrast this
project calls up past weather data from a website through API and a Machine Learning model (LSTM) 
is trained on this historical data to make predictions about tomorrow.

### Project Version
The project is still under development and many improvements 
can be made.
